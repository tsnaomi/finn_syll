# Syllabification rules

**T0**:
Indicates that no syllabification rules have applied.

<!-- **T1b**: If there is a consonant cluster word-initially, the entire cluster forms the onset of the first syllable. -->

<!-- **T1c**: If there is a consonant cluster word-finally, the entire cluster forms the coda of the final syllable. -->

<!-- **T1d**: If there is a bare "Finnish" consonant cluster word-medially and the previous syllable receives stress, the first consonant of the cluster forms the coda of the previous syllable (to create a heavy syllable); otherwise, the whole cluster forms the onset of the current syllable (this is the /kr/ rule). -->

<!-- **T1e**: If there is a word-medial "Finnish" consonant cluster that is preceded by a sonorant consonant, if the previous syllable receives stress, the sonorant consonant and the first consonant of the cluster form the coda of the previous syllable, and the remainder of the cluster forms the onset of the current syllable. -->

<!-- **T1f**: If there is a word-medial "Finnish" cluster that follows a consonant, that first consonant forms the coda of the previous syllable, and the cluster forms the onset of the current syllable. T1e bleeds T1f. -->

<!-- **T1a**: There is a syllable boundary in front of every CV sequence. -->

**T1**: There is a syllable boundary in front of every CV sequence.

**T2**:
There is a syllable boundary within a sequence VV of two nonidentical vowels that are not a genuine diphthong<!-- , e.g., [ta.e], [ko.et.taa] -->.


**T8**:
Split /ie/, /uo/, and /yö/ sequences in syllables that do not take primary stress.


**T4**:
An agglutination diphthong that ends in /u, y/ optionally contains a syllable boundary if it does not take primary stress<!-- , e.g., [lau.ka.us], [va.ka.ut.taa] -->. *Produces variation.*

**T11**:
If a primary-stressed VVV sequence contains a /u, y/-final diphthong and the third vowel is /i/, there is a syllable boundary between the diphthong and /i/.


**T6**:
If a VVV-sequence contains a long vowel, there is a syllable boundary between it and the third vowel<!-- , e.g. [kor.ke.aa], [yh.ti.öön], [ruu.an], [mää.yt.te] -->.

**T5**:
If a (V)VVV-sequence contains a VV-sequence that could be an /i/-final diphthong, there is a syllable boundary between it and the third vowel<!-- , e.g., [raa.ois.sa], [huo.uim.me], [la.eis.sa], [sel.vi.äi.si], [tai.an], [säi.e], [oi.om.me] -->.


**T7**:
If a VVV-sequence does not contain a potential /i/-final diphthong, there is a syllable boundary between the second and third vowels<!-- , e.g. [kau.an], [leu.an], [kiu.as] -->.
