Since we can split these syllables, we do not see the repair in which the stress shifts to an even syllable. (Consider this repair during stress assignment later.) By implementing this at the syllabifier layer, we will not have to repair syllabifications at the stress assignment layer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tie\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; da.ni.el, *da.niel\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vei\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; es.se.is.ti, *es.seis.ti\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tiu\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.van.ke.li.u.me.ja, *e.van.ke.liu.me.ja\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no.vel.lien, \\*no.vel.li.en < *the last syllable is extrametrical*\r\n\r\nExtrametricality does not apply to the various morphemes in a compound -- it only applies to the compound as a whole.

I marked \"ru.ois.sa\" as the correct syllabification (gold). However, I suspect in the context where I saw this word it might well come from the word /ruoka/ (i.e., the lexical analysis is wrong) in which case the correct syllabification would be \"ruo.is.sa\". Naomi, maybe we should undo this word's \"gold\" and mark it as unchecked, so I can check it in context. Or maybe we should leave it as is because the syllabification is correct for the root /ruko/. I think we should leave it as is.\r\n#### taus.taa\r\nAn underlying [k] is deleted: \"ta.[k]us.taa\"\r\n#### niäminen\r\ndialectal (spelling post-lexical pronunciation)\r\n#### tiäräks\r\ndialectal (spelling post-lexical pronunciation)\r\n  \r\n##[§](https://github.com/tsnaomi/finnsyll/generated_pages/new)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
