E.g., *rakkauden*.\r\n- Can we complicate T4 to only care about onsets and not codas?\r\n- Can we use back/front vowel harmony to detect compound boundaries?\r\n\r\n### Q & A\r\n- **Does the syllabifier always join long vowels?** Yes, this rule is encompassed in T6.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[Edit](https://github.com/tsnaomi/finnsyll/generated_pages/new)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
